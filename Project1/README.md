# Project 1 : Bank Customer Churn Prediction

The purpose of this project is to identify which customers are likely to exit from a bank. This involves several steps, including data preprocessing, dataset transformation, training a neural network, and optimizing the model to prevent overfitting.

## Steps Involved

1. Data Preprocessing
    * Eliminate duplicate records.
    * Fill null values.
    * Rescale the data.

2. Dataset Transformation
    * Convert the dataset into a format that is understandable for the input of a neural network.

3. Dataset Splitting
    * Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. Parameter Tuning
    * Find the optimum neural network architecture and parameters for this dataset.

5. Overfitting Recognition and Mitigation
    * Recognize overfitting issues.
    * Use regularization and dropout techniques to overcome overfitting.
