# Fraud Detection Using Autoencoder

The purpose of this project is to detect fraudulent transactions using an autoencoder on the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset. By training the autoencoder on normal (non-fraudulent) data, the model learns the normal patterns and distribution of the data. Therefore, we expect that for normal data, the reconstruction error will be low. Conversely, if the reconstruction error is high for certain data points, they are likely to be fraudulent
